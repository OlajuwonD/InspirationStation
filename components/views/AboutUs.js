<h2>About Us:</h2>
<p>This website was inspired by the struggles of re-entering society after being affected  by the US State and Federal Justice system. From my experience lack of motivation and inspiration during one's transition is a major contributor to recidivism and stagnation on the road to recovery. 
As you continue to endure the roadblocks and difficulties associated with building a new foundation for yourself, hopefully the words and images shared on this website will illuminate your path enough so that you can take that needed step toward a full-recovery and pro-social lifestyle. <p>
